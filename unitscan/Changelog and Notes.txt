Find a way to not add a dead unit to button.
Make keybinds in default Blizzard Keybindings menu for Add/Remove current Target, Click button, Close button.
Add a slash command to disable scanning entirely.
Make scanning in raids optional via slash command, by default enabled. (Is it already disabled by default?)
Add optional model viewer, via slash command, by default disabled.
After adding new commands need to put them into /unitscan help command so that when someone do /unitscan to check for targets he doesnt get spammed with all of them.
Add description of /ignore command in /unitscan slash.
